# Visual HTML+CSS editor
![Preview](/public/page-editor.gif)

I created this project for a hackathon I did for a job application in 2023.

## Features
The goal was to create an application where you can upload HTML and CSS files and then visually edit them.

You can:
- Upload HTML & CSS files
- Select elements by clicking on them or by clicking on their node in the sidebar
- Edit `opacity`, `border-radius`, `width`, `max-width`, `height` and `max-height`
- Download a new .html file with the changed styles

## Stack
- Typescript
- Next.js
- Zustand
- Tailwind
- Framer Motion
